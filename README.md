# SomeSoftwareEngineering

This is some of the code written while taking part in DD2385 Software Engineering at The Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm. Model-view-controller designpattern/architecture, compsite pattern where collection of instances are treated the same way, factory pattern where type of an object is decided by it's arguments, implementation of iterator in custom class, depth-first search (graph search), breadth-first search, singleton where only one instance of the class is allowed, building tree structures from textfiles, synchronized server/client communication. I decided to use the java swing library during the course.
